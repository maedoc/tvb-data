EEG sensor orientations and labeling.
They originate from http://www.brainproducts.com/

The orientations have been aligned with the tvb default surfaces, specifically rotated by -90 along +z.
( the transformation was done from the tvb h5 after import by tvb_data/view_h5_3d.py:_rotate_eeg_sensors )
