TVB-DATA
=====================

Various demonstration data for use with TVB are provided here.

Here we will find compatible file/folder structures to be uploaded in TVB software,
but also files for loading default datatypes when working in console mode.

This should be treated as a regular Python module.
Possibly what you want after cloning this locally, it to run

    python setup.py develop

to have it linked into your current Python instance.
